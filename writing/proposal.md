Game theory can be defined as a study of mathematics in which the players’ actions are taken into account to develop winning strategies. The field has expanded in recent years and now has connections in biology, political science, and, of course, computer science. Programs can be designed to find solutions for complex games. Furthermore, there exists an area of study called algorithmic mechanism design, first coined in 1999 by Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen, “that aims to design games whose equilibria have desired properties such as achieving high efficiency or high revenue,” (Nisan 1). Additionally, game theory can involve binary arithmetic and logic that directly correlates to computer science. These factors have led us to our research idea of investigating game theory and creating a program to help facilitate research.

Our team will work to divide the load per person as equally as possible while taking into consideration the strengths of each member. For example, both Simon and Zach have had previous experience with game theory and LaTeX thus making them the most knowledgeable on the subject. Since mathematical writing is primarily done using LaTeX, it will be beneficial to have members that can use this format in order to help make our research presentable. Our group also has experience with Python, which will allow us to create some sample game theory programs Our reference, a book titled, Introducing Game Theory and its Applications, details a plethora of game types and the strategy a player should use in order to have the best chance at winning. In addition to this book, there are many articles and scholarly sources that we will use to help with preliminary research.

The main game we will focus on is the simple game called Nim. This game is a staple in game theory since it demonstrates logical thinking and mathematical strategies that are key in both game theory and computer science. Nim is an impartial combinatorial game where two players take turns removing a number of chips from distinct piles. It is considered impartial because the only difference between player one and player two is that player one goes first. Essentially, the players want to be the last one to be able to take a turn, so they can either clear the pile or leave a certain number such that the opposing player cannot take them. The only exists one winning strategy which can be calculated by finding the minimum excludend (mex) or by taking the bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of the corresponding numbers. By having this information, we will be able to create programs that can calculate winners of Nim games based on information given. Not only will we be able to calculate them, but theoretically, we should be able to play Nim games against the computer. All of these components, combined with LaTeX visuals will provide us with the ability to create a well-rounded research project.
