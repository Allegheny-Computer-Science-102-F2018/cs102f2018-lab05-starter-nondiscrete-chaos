# Ideas and articles

## Date: 24 Oct 2018

## Group Names: Zach Leonardo, Simon Burrows, Andrew Everitt, Chris Cook

Chris joined our group after we came up with the ideas so unfortunately he was not able to participate much initially. Moving forward, we will be incorporating his ideas into the project.

For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.

### Idea 1 - Primes and other number categorizations

## Andrew

1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Our group will research and design a program that can determine various categorizations of a user-inputted number. For example, if the user entered the number six into the program it would determine that it is a non-prime and perfect number that isn't a part of the Fibonacci sequence. It would also be able to provide the definition of each category. According to Fermat's library, a perfect number is an integer that is also the sum of all of its proper divisors (6 = 1+2+3).

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea connects to computer science because technology is being utilized to make calculations that would otherwise be extremely tedious time-wise by hand. Since there are an infinite prime numbers, there are constantly more being found. Furthermore, we could use different data structures to quickly return previous results, by number or by category. Additionally, the use prime numbers for security purposes has grown over the life of the internet.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
This book proved to be a supportive reference to this idea: <http://bit.ly/ACCS102ref1>

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The book makes a plethora of points. It provides a mathematical background for the history of prime numbers as well as at least one equation to find them. It also includes a complete chapter about the growing role of prime numbers in cryptography, where they are used in data security.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This book supports our idea because although prime numbers seem like a basic concept void of importance in everyday life, they play a role in the security of our data, namely passwords and other highly valuable information.

### Idea 2 - Game Theory and Exploration with Computer Science

## Simon

1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Another idea that we could research is the intersection of game theory and computer science. Game theory is a study of mathematics that focuses on how people play certain types of games and the possible moves that are mathematically possible.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
In computer science and in game theory, there are decisions that are determined via calculations. By researching moves in specific games such as Nim or a Takeaway game, we can use computer science to create programs that determine the outcomes under different situations.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
This book explains the basics of game theory and explores multiple types of games in depth. One such example is the explanation and demonstrations of Nim type games.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This will help support our idea by giving a large amount of background information for us to do initial research on. It gives a good base for what we need to learn in order to explore game theory. We can then take the ideas from the book and try to come up with algorithms/programs that prove some aspects of game theory that we plan to research.

### Idea 3 - Boolean connection to DNA testing

## Zach

1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Our group will research the intersection of boolean logic and DNA manipulation. The boolean operators such as AND, OR, XOR and so on have applications to DNA strand displacement reactions. It would be easy to implement a multiple input sequential logic problem in Python, and writing the algorithm to solve it.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
We use boolean logic to evaluate truth tables and other applications specifically in this course. Outside of discrete structures it is implied in circuit generation and other organizational fields that use sequential logic.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.7b04040>

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The main discussion of this article comes from the idea of programmable cell surface remodeling, and how DNA toehold can change the cell kinetics. The article also supplies the method of using boolean logic gates to determine DNA strand displacement reactions.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article gives us a good discussion point for the applications of boolean logic functions to the field of biology and genetics. Boolean logic is coded into our DNA, and this article explains a heavily scientific, but accurate observation for this point.

### Idea 4 - Spread of Fake News and AI to combat it

## Simon

1) Explain your idea for a class project.
One research idea could be to look into the recent trend of fake news and the new systems being developed to combat it. Many companies are trying to put an emphasis on reducing instances of fake news with new AI and algorithms that detect potential threats and brings attention to them.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to computer science since machine learning and other new technologies are being developed since there is too much activity for just humans to sort through. By creating new ways of filtering and analyzing, a lot of human review can be eliminated and fake news can be found more easily.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
<http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-csail-machine-learning-system-detects-fake-news-from-source-1004>

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The central idea of the article is that due to social media being new and easily manipulated, tech companies are starting to focus on creating their own ways of eliminated fake news from their sites. It seems to be a growing issue that is starting to be addressed with tech but it is not completely fool proof just yet.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article shows that technology companies care about the spread of fake news and as a result are focusing on another side of computer science to combat it. By creating new AI to address fake news, it shows that this is an important issue that needs computer science in order to solve.

### Idea 5 - Development of online learning algorithms

## Andrew

1) Explain your idea for a class project.
This idea would look at the various systems implemented most notably by large-scale corporations such as Google (Alphabet) and Amazon in order to "better serve" the consumer, decreasing the amount of time needed to find a desired solution (information or product).

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is strongly rooted in computer science because the companies are using specially crafted algorithms to produce results that the user may be sub-conscientiously thinking about. As the algorithm gains more and more data from consumers, it becomes even better at predicting end-result. Thus, the more information that a person shares, the better the recommendations that the algorithm will be able to provide.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
<http://thuvien.thanglong.edu.vn:8081/dspace/handle/DHTL_123456789/4010>

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The book covers a lot of information in regards to the artificial intelligence field. Our group will focus on anything and everything that has to do with the understanding of the mind of those browsing and/or shopping on the internet and how advanced algorithms enable more of this behavior.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This article will support our idea by providing extensive background on the algorithms and their role and that of artificial intelligence in our online lives. Specifically, it will help when we look at how these systems learn and use not only the information of the user, but that of others in order to increase the company and its system(s) own value.
